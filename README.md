## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should runs on Python versions 3 and above.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from 2017 to better understand:

1.What neighborhoods share similar average prices? Where do you look for an Airbnb given a specific budget?
2.What are the top 10 neighborhood groups in terms of average listing price?
3.Which review score has the highest correlation with the listing price?
4.What are the predictors for the listed price, and how do we price a house on Airbnb?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one jupyter notebook and a link to my medium blog posting 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available on Medium: https://medium.com/swlh/what-features-contribute-to-the-listing-price-on-airbnb-21af2703b269
