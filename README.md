## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from 2017 to better understand:

1.What are the top 5 neigborhood in terms of average listing price?
2. .What are the bottom 5 neigborhood in terms of average listing price?
3. Which review scores has the highest correlation with listed price?
3. How bias played a role in the suggestions of developers for how to break into the field?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one jupyter notebook and a link to my medium blog posting 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available
